<i>Please note, this repository is a work in progress and will be updated over time.</i>

In this repository, I incorporated Code::Blocks Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
and the Vim text editor along with Git and GitHub into my workflow. I also used the
Fedora 37 system in a VirtualBox environment to create, use, and manage directories
and files as I worked through the section.

See the following link for the Code::Blocks IDE user manual and documentation: <a href="https://www.codeblocks.org/user-manual/" title="CodeBlocks User Manual" target="_blank" alt="CodeBlocks User Manual">CodeBlocks User Manual</a>

Please feel free to reach out to me at devildoc300@gmail.com if you have any questions
or comments. In addition, feel free to utilize the source code for your consumption
and edification.
