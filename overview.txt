Indirection

	- pointers are very similar to the concept of indirection that you
	  employ in your everyday life
		+ suppose you need to buy a new ink cartridge for your
		  printer
		+ all purchases are handled by the purchasing department
			- you call Joe in purchasing and ask him to order
			  the new cartridge for you
			- Joe then calls the local supply store to order
			  the cartridge
		+ you are not ordering the cartridge directly from the 
		  supply store yourself (indirection)

	- in programming languages, indirection is the ability to reference
	  something using a name, reference, or container, instead of the
	  value itself

	- the most common form of indirection is the act of manipulating
	  a value through its memory address

	- a pointer provides an indirect means of accessing the value of
	  a particular data item
		+ a variable whose value is a memory address
		+ its value is the address of another location in memory
		  that can contain a value

	- just as there are reasons why it makes sense to go through the
	  purchasing department to order new cartridges (you don't have
	  to know which particular store the cartridges are being ordered
	  from)
		+ there are good reasons why it makes sense to use pointers
		  in C

	- using pointers in your program is one of the most powerful tools
	  available in the C language

	- pointers are also one of the most confusing concepts of the C
	  language
		+ it is important you get this concept figured out in 
		  the beginning and maintain a clear idea of what is
		  happening as you dig deeper

	- the compiler must know the type of data stored in the variable
	  to which it points
		+ need to know how much memory is occupied or how to 
		  handle the contents of the memory to which it points
		+ every pointer will be associated with a specific 
		  variable type
		+ it can be used only to poitn to variables of that type

	- pointers of type "pointer to int" can point only to variables
 	  of type int
	- pointers of type "pointer to float" can point only to variables
	  of type float

	Example:

	int number = 99;
	int *pnumber = &number;

	// &number is the Address, say 1008
	// pnumber is 1008
	// number is 99


Why Use Pointers?

	- accessing data by means of only variables is very limiting
		+ with pointers, you can access any location (you can
		  treat any position of memory as a variable for
		  example) and perform arithmetic with pointers

	- pointers in C make it easier to use arrays and strings

	- pointers allow you to refer to the same space in memory
	  from multiple locations
		+ means that you can update memory in one location
		  and the change can be seen from another location
		  in your program
		+ can also save space by being able to share components
		  in your data structures

	- pointers allow functions to modify data passed to them
	  as variables
		+ pass by reference - passing arguments to function
		  in a way they can be changed by function

	- can also be used to optimize a program to run faster or
	  use less memory than it would otherwise

	- pointers allow use to get multiple values from the function
		+ a function can return only one value but by
		  passing arguments as pointers we can get more than
		  one values from the pointer

	- with pointers, dynamic memory can be created according to
	  the program use
		+ we can save memory from static (compile time)
		  declarations

	- pointers allow us to design and develop complex data
	  structures like a stack, queue, or linked list

	- pointers provide direct memory access
