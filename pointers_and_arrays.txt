Section 12: Pointers and Arrays
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview

	- an array is a collection of objects of the same type
	  that you can refer to using a single name

	  int array_example[50];

	- a pointer is a variable that has as its value a memory
	  address that can reference another variable or constant
	  of a given type
		+ you can use a pointer to hold the address of
		  different variables at different times (must
		  be same type)

	- arrays and pointers seem quite different, but, they
	  are very closely related and can sometimes be used
	  interchangeably

	- one of the most common uses of pointers in C is as
	  pointers to arrays

	- the main reasons for using pointers to arrays are
	  ones of notational convenience and of program
	  efficiency

	- pointers to arrays generally result in code that
	  uses less memory and executes faster


Arrays and Pointers

	- if you have an array of 100 integers
	
	  int values[100;

	- you can define a pointer called valuesPtr, which
	  can be used to access the integers contained in
	  this array

	  int *valuesPtr;

	- when you define a pointer that is used to point to
	  the elements of an array, you do not designate the
	  pointer as type "pointer to array"
		+ you designate the pointer as pointing to 
		  the type of element that is contained in 
		  the array

	- to set valuesPtr to point to the first element in
	  the values array, you write

	  valuePtr = values;

	- the address operator is not used
		+ the C compiler treats the appearance of an
		  array name without a subscript as a pointer
		  to the array
		+ specifying values without a subscript has
		  the effect of producing a pointer to the
		  first element of values

	- an equivalent way of producing a pointer to the 
	  start of values is to apply the address operator
	  to the first element of the array

	  valuesPtr = &values[0];

	- so, you can use the above example or the example
	  below

	  valuesPtr = values;

	- either one is fine and is a matter of programmer
	  preference


Summary

	- the two expressions ar[i] and *(ar+i) are 
	  equivalent in meaning
		+ both work if ar is the name of an array,
		  and both work if ar is a pointer variable
		+ using an expression such as ar++ only works
		  if ar is a pointer variable
