Section 12: Pointers and const
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview

	- when we use the const modifier on a variable or an array
	  it tells the compiler that the contents of the variable/
	  array will not be changed by the program

	- with pointers, we have to consider two things when using
	  the const modifier
		+ whether the pointer will be changed
		+ whether the value that the pointer points to will
	  	  be changed

	- you can use the const keyword when you declare a pointer 
	  to indicate that the value pointed to must not be changed

	  long value = 9999L;
	  const long *pvalue = &value;	// defines a pointer to a constant

	- you have declared the value pointed to by pvalue to be
	  const
		+ the compiler will check for any statements that
		  attempt to modify the value pointed to by pvalue
		  and flag such statements as an error

	- the following statement will now result in an error
	  message from the compiler

	- *pvalue = 8888L;	// error - attempt to change const location


Pointers to constants

	- you can still modify value (you have only applied const to 
	  the pointer)

	  value = 7777L;

	- the value pointed to has changed, but you did not use the
	  pointer to make the change

	- the pointer itself is not constant, so you can still change
	  what it points to

	  long number = 8888L;
	  pvalue = &number;	// OK - changing the address in pvalue

	- will change the address stored in pvalue to point to number
		+ still cannot use the pointer to change the value
		  that is stored
		+ you can change the address stored in the pointer as
		  much as you like
		+ using the pointer to change the value pointed to is
		  not allowed, even after you have changed the address
		  stored in the pointer


Constant Pointers

	- you might also want to ensure that the address stored in a
	  pointer cannot be changed

	- you can do this by using the const keyword in the declaration
	  of the pointer

	  int count = 43;
	  int *const pcount = &count;	// defines a constant pointer

	- the above ensures that a pointer always points to the same
	  thing
		+ indicates that the address stored must not be changed
		+ compiler will check that you do not inadvertently
		  attempt to change what the pointer points to else-
		  where in you code

	  int item = 34;
	  pcount = &item;	// error - attempt to change a constant pointer

	- it is all about where you place the const keyword, either
	  before the type or after the type
		+ const int *...	// value cannot be changed
		+ int *const ...	// pointer address cannot be changed

	- you can still change the value that pcount points to using
	  pcount

	  *pcount = 345;	// OK -changes the value of count

	- references the value stored in count through the pointer
	  and changes it value to 345

	- you can create a constant pointer that points to a value
	  that is also constant

	  int item = 25;
	  const int *const pitem = &item;

	- the pitem is a constant pointer to a constant so everything
	  is fixed
		+ cannot change the address stored in pitem
		+ cannot use pitem to modify what it points to

	- you can still change the value of item directly
		+ if you wanted to make everything not change, you
		  could specify item as const as well
