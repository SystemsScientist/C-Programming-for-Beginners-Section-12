Section 12: Void Pointers
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview

	- the type name void means absence of any type

	- a pointer of type void* can contain the address of a data
	  item of any type

	- void* is often used as a parameter type or return value
	  type with functions that deal with data in a type-
	  independent way

	- any kind of pointer can be passed around as a value of 
	  type void*
		+ the void pointer does not know what type of object
		  it is pointing to, so, it cannot be dereferenced
		  directly
		+ the void pointer must first be explicitly cast to
		  another pointer type before it is dereferenced

	- the address of a variable of type int can be stored 
	  in a pointer variable of type void*

	- when you want to access the integer value at the address
	  stored in teh void* pointer, you must first cast the 
	  pointer to type int*

Example

	  int i = 10;
	  float f = 2.34;
	  char ch = 'k';

	  void *vptr;

	  vptr = &i;
	  printf("Value of i = %d\n", *(int *)vptr);
	
	  vptr = &f;
	  printf("Value of f = %.2f\n", *(float *)vptr);

	  vptr = &ch;
	  printf("Value of ch = %c\n", *(char *)vptr);
